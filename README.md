### What I learned

1. Img/icon svg as a link or toogle's button can be nested in anchor or button tag

```html
<!-- Social media icons -->
<a><img /></a>

<!-- Toogle icon -->
<button><img /></button>
```

2. Change the color of svg in fill atribute in the svg's code.

3. Object-fit and object-position properties. Object-fit: scale-down for smaller svgs.

4. This form of ternary operator

```js
popup.style.display = popup.style.display === "flex" ? "none" : "flex";
```

5. Different methodologies about ordering the properties in css selectors â€“ type and alphabetic.
